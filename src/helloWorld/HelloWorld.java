//Basic anatomy of a java program

// package organize classes 
// PascalCase is used for classes names
package helloWorld;

//classes organize methods 
public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// inside a class it is called a method, but out of a class it is called a function
		// camelCase is used for methods names
		// the main method is from the program starts its execution
	}
}

// the bytecode is what will be translated into the language that the SO the program is running and it is stored at the .class of the program 
// javac HelloWorld.java + ls at the project package folder in the terminal will display the HelloWorld.java and HelloWorld.class files
